## Chapter 3: Basic Streaming with Redpanda
In Chapter 3 of the [Hands-on Redpanda, Getting Started course][course-link], we work through "Hello, World"-style Redpanda tutorials for the following languages:

- Java ([Maven](https://github.com/redpanda-data-university/02-hands-on-redpanda-getting-started/tree/main/03-basic-streaming/java-tutorial-maven), [Gradle](/03-basic-streaming/java-tutorial-gradle))
- [Python](/03-basic-streaming/python-tutorial)
- [NodeJS](https://github.com/redpanda-data-university/02-hands-on-redpanda-getting-started/tree/main/03-basic-streaming/node-tutorial)

Click on the link of the appropriate language above to view the code for the corresponding tutorial. Note: the [Gradle example](/03-basic-streaming/java-tutorial-gradle) is a bonus example that was not included in the course. We include it here since many Java users use Gradle instead of Maven.
